=============

**LogMaster4Net** is a central log server which can receive log messages of your other applications and organize them as your demand. It can help you to manage your all applications log messages in a central place. So if you have lots of different applications running and most of them have their own logging, this project will be pretty useful for you.

**LogMaster4Net** actually is a UDP server which is base on **SuperSocket**
